## About The Project

This project demonstrates a high level system system diagram on how to design GMAIL covering only the core functionality of sending/receiving emails with fewer APIs for client listing purposes. 

More ever, please find below links for all the flow-diagrams on how the GMAIL application will work on high level basis:

[System Flow Diagram][flow-diagram]

[Sending Email][send-email-diagram]

[Receiving Email][receive-email-diagram]

I have also created a document explaining other details, please try to have a look at that document as well. Thanks.
